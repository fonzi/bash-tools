# Usage: session_manager.sh [path/to/your.ovpn]
#
# This script starts an OpenVPN connection using the provided .ovpn configuration file,
# displays a warning message while the VPN is connected, and provides a menu for managing
# the VPN session. It also shows a system tray icon indicating that the VPN is connected.
#
# Requirements:
# - openvpn3
# - yad (for the system tray icon)
#
# Installation of requirements:
# sudo apt-get install openvpn3 yad
#
# If the .ovpn file path is not provided as a command-line argument, the script will prompt for it.
#
# Menu Options:
# 1) Show current sessions - Displays the current OpenVPN sessions.
# 2) Show available configurations - Lists available OpenVPN configurations.
# 3) Exit - Stops the OpenVPN connection and exits the script.
#
# Example usage:
# ./session_manager.sh /path/to/your.ovpn
# ./session_manager.sh (will prompt for the .ovpn file path)

# Function to handle Ctrl+C and exit
